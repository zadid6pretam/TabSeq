#TabSeq: A Framework for Deep Learning on Tabular Data via Sequential Ordering
Introduction
Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in fields such as image processing, NLP, and audio analysis. However, its application to tabular data remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of features and their varying levels of relevance. This repository introduces TabSeq, a framework that employs feature ordering to optimize the learning process on tabular data.

TabSeq leverages:

Clustering to group similar features.
Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to focus on key characteristics.
Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) to enhance feature importance by reconstructing distorted inputs.
These techniques combine to significantly improve deep learning performance on tabular datasets.

Key Contributions
Feature Ordering:

A novel technique that combines local and global ordering for optimizing feature sequences.
Features are prioritized by relevance to improve model performance.
Integration of MHA and DAE:

MHA highlights essential features.
DAE reduces redundancy by reconstructing input data.
Demonstrated Effectiveness:

Validated on real-world biomedical datasets, showing significant accuracy improvements.
Methodology
Feature Ordering:

Features are arranged to minimize dispersion within clusters.
A global permutation is derived to optimize feature relationships across clusters.
Model Architecture:

Denoising Autoencoder (DAE): Learns robust feature representations by reconstructing noisy inputs.
Multi-Head Attention (MHA): Enhances the model's ability to focus on critical feature interactions.
Classifier:

Processes extracted features for binary or multi-class classification.

Datasets
TabSeq has been evaluated on:

Autoimmune Diseases Dataset: 393 features, 5 classes.
ADNI Dataset: 263 features, targets Alzheimer's disease stages.
WDBC Dataset: 32 features for breast cancer classification.
Results
Demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and AUC across multiple datasets.
Achieved 87.23% accuracy on the Autoimmune Diseases dataset with feature ordering.
Outperformed existing models such as TabNet, NODE, and TabTransformer in various scenarios.
